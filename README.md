A bit of everything dev, 20yr C#, some years Python, some C++. 

I would like to find something to contribute, too. I once built a robotic lawnmower with some Arduinos. I also built low-latency systems. 

I recently built a WHS implementation and some web crawlers (one of them does 15m pages a month). Most of my work is taking data from sources on the internet and adding value. 

I write some stuff on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/undefinedfunction/).

I have 2 cocker spaniels. They can be d1kcheads.
